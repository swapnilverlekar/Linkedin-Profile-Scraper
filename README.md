### Libraries
To get started, we need the following libraries:<br>
```pip install selenium```
<br>
```pip install beautifulsoup4```

### Web Driver
For using selenium, we also need a web driver. Any web driver works (Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome).<br>
I have used Chrome web driver for my code.<br>
Link for [Chrome web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started)<br>
Provide the downloaded web driver location to the ```path``` variable<br>
